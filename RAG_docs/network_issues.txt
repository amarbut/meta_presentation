For suspected network issues in conference rooms:

- Check the network status light on the switch under the table.
- Try switching to a backup Wi-Fi SSID if available.
- If all rooms in a region are offline, escalate to the network on-call.

Note: Room tablets use PoE+ and may reboot during switch outages.
