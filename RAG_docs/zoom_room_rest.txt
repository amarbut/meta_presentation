If a Zoom Room tablet is unresponsive, press and hold the power button for 10 seconds to force a restart.

If the room display is frozen or black, unplug the HDMI cable from the display and plug it back in. Wait at least 10 seconds before retrying.

Do not reboot the room controller unless absolutely necessary.
